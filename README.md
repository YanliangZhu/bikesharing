## Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to examine the NYC Cite Bike usage data, visualize the distribution of data point filter by various category, such as age, gender, and location, in terms of statistical and geological.

## Result

- Checkout Time for Users
	- We can see that the majority of users checkout their bike at the bingeing of 0h.
- Checkout Time by Genders
	- Male are the major user of the bike
- Trips by Weekdays
	- The peak usage during the work day is 8am and 5~6PM, and 10AM~5PM during the weekend.
- Trip by Gender
	- There is no significant difference in gender as far as we can observe from the heat-map 
- User Type and Gender
	- Majority of subscribers are female, used consistently during the week
- Age and Starting Location
	- As we can see, older users tend to start their ride on the Manhattan downtown area. Whereas younger people tend to start in a relatively further from downtown/central area.
- Age and Starting time
	- Younger users start riding throughout the day; whereas older users tend to start riding during the day-time.

## Summary

I found that age is a big determine in the user behaviour. For older population, they tend to use the bike during the day time, and they tend to use in downtown locations. For younger population, they tend to use the bike thought out the day, and their starting location tend to spread out in New York City. From that, I would recommend to target older users because their usage location is more concentrated, as well as their usage hours. These factors could leads to a lower level of maintain cost for the company.
